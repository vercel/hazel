> Why do I have a folder named ".now" in my project?
The ".now" folder is created when you link a directory to a ZEIT Now project.

> What does the "project.json" file contain?
The "project.json" file contains:
- The ID of the ZEIT Now project that you linked ("projectId")
- The ID of the user or team your ZEIT Now project is owned by ("orgId")

> Should I commit the ".now" folder?
No, you should not share the ".now" folder with anyone.
