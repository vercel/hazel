This project lets you deploy an update server for [Electron](https://electron.atom.io) apps with ease: You only need to run a single command and fill out two text fields.

The result will be faster and more lightweight than any other solution out there! :rocket:

- Built on top of [micro](https://github.com/zeit/micro), the tiniest HTTP framework for Node.js
- Pulls the latest release data from [GitHub Releases](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/) and caches it in memory
- Refreshes the cache every **15 minutes** (custom interval [possible](#options))
- When asked for an update, it returns the link to the GitHub asset directly (saves bandwidth)
- Supports **macOS** and **Windows** apps
- Scales very nicely across multiple [Now](https://zeit.co/now) instances

## Usage

With [Now CLI](https://zeit.co/download), you can deploy an update server like this:

```bash
now -e NODE_ENV="production" zeit/hazel
```

You'll be asked for the value of two environment variables:

- `ACCOUNT`: Your username or organisation name on GitHub
- `REPOSITORY`: The name of the repository to pull releases from
- `PORT`: The port on which Hazel should run
- `TOKEN`: Your GitHub token (for private repos)
- `URL` or `NOW_URL`: The server's URL (for private repos - when running on [Now](https://zeit.co/now), this field is filled with the URL of the deployment automatically)

Once it's deployed, paste the deployment address into your code (please keep in mind that updates should only occur in the production version of the app, not while developing):

```js
const { app, autoUpdater } = require('electron')

const server = <your-deployment-url>
const feed = `${server}/update/${process.platform}/${app.getVersion()}`

autoUpdater.setFeedURL(feed)
```

That's it! :white_check_mark:

From now on, the auto updater will ask your Hazel deployment for updates!

## Options

The following environment variables can be used optionally:

- `INTERVAL`: Refreshes the cache every x minutes ([restrictions](https://developer.github.com/changes/2012-10-14-rate-limit-changes/))
- `NODE_ENV`: Should always be "production", which ensures that only required dependencies are installed
- `PRE`: When defined with a value of `1`, only prereleases will be cached

## Statistics

Since Hazel routes all the traffic for downloading the actual application files to [GitHub Releases](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/), you can use their API to determine the download count for a certain release.

As an example, check out the [latest Now Desktop release](https://api.github.com/repos/zeit/now-desktop/releases/latest) and search for `mac.zip`. You'll find a release containing a sub property named `download_count` with the amount of downloads as its value.

## Routes

### /

Automatically detects the platform/OS of the visitor by parsing the user agent and then downloads the appropriate copy of your application.

If the latest version of the application wasn't yet pulled from [GitHub Releases](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/), it will return a message and the status code `404`. The same happens if the latest release doesn't contain a file for the detected platform.

### /download

Does the same as `/` (basically an alias).

### /download/:platform

Accepts a platform (like "darwin" or "win32") to download the appropriate copy your app for. I generally suggest using either `process.platform` ([more](https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#process_process_platform)) or `os.platform()` ([more](https://nodejs.org/api/os.html#os_os_platform)) to retrieve this string.

If the cache isn't filled yet or doesn't contain a download link for the specified platform, it will respond like `/`.

### /update/:platform/:version

Checks if there is an update available by reading from the cache.

If the latest version of the application wasn't yet pulled from [GitHub Releases](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/), it will return the `204` status code. The same happens if the latest release doesn't contain a file for the specified platform.

### /update/win32/:version/RELEASES

This endpoint was specifically crafted for the Windows platform (called "win32" [in Node.js](https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#process_process_platform)).

Since the [Windows version](https://github.com/Squirrel/Squirrel.Windows) of Squirrel (the software that powers auto updates inside [Electron](https://electron.atom.io)) requires access to a file named "RELEASES" when checking for updates, this endpoint will respond with a cached version of the file that contains a download link to a `.nupkg` file (the application update).

## Contributing

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository to your own GitHub account and then [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) it to your local device
2. Move into the directory of your clone: `cd hazel`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`

Huge thanks to my ([@leo](https://github.com/leo)'s) friend [Andy](http://twitter.com/andybitz_), who suggested the name "Hazel" (since the auto updater software inside [Electron](https://electron.atom.io) is called "Squirrel") and [Matheus](https://twitter.com/matheusfrndes) for collecting ideas with me.
